### Overview
This research project explores **hybrid deep learning methods for forecasting ocean wave conditions** — in particular, the *significant wave height* (SWH) recorded by the **M6 buoy** off the west coast of Ireland.  
While physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) models provide reliable large-scale forecasts, they often exhibit **systematic local biases** and limited short-term accuracy.  
Here, we design deep neural networks that **learn the residuals between numerical forecasts and real observations**, effectively correcting physical model outputs through data-driven learning.

This work lies at the intersection of **scientific machine learning, time-series forecasting, and physical modeling** — bridging AI and oceanography in the context of the EU-funded **HIGHWAVE project**.

---

## Goals & Contributions
- **Reimplement and benchmark** state-of-the-art long-term time-series architectures (LSTM, TCN, PatchTST, SegRNN) on benchmark and real datasets.  
- **Build a robust forecasting pipeline** handling missing data and contiguous sliding-window sampling for marine time series.  
- **Propose a hybrid residual-learning framework** combining numerical forecasts (NOAA, ICON, MFWAM, etc.) with deep learning.  
- **Demonstrate measurable accuracy gains** over both standalone deep learning and raw physical forecasts.

## Datasets
| Dataset | Source | Resolution | Purpose |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **weather.csv** | Public meteorological dataset | 10 min | Model benchmarking and architecture testing |
| **M6 Observational** | Irish Marine Data Buoy Network | 1 h | Real-world univariate SWH forecasting |

## Methodology
### 1. Forecasting formulation

For each 24-hour horizon \(H\), models use the past \(L = 336\) hours to predict the next 24 hours:

$$
f_\theta\left(X_{t-L:t}\right) \approx Y_{t+1:t+H}
$$

In the **hybrid** setup, models learn residuals:

$$
r_\theta(R_t) \approx Y - \hat{Y}_{\text{num}}, \qquad
\hat{Y} = \hat{Y}_{\text{num}} + r_\theta(R_t)
$$

### 2. Architectures Evaluated
- **LSTM** – Recurrent baseline for temporal dependencies  
- **TCN** – Causal dilated convolutions for sequence modeling  
- **PatchTST** – Transformer with patchwise attention for long-context forecasting [[Nie et al., 2023]](#references)  
- **SegRNN** – Segment Recurrent Neural Network optimized for long-term forecasting [[Lin et al., 2024]](#references)  
- **XGBoost** – Gradient-boosted tree baseline

### Hybrid Residual Learning

Physics-based numerical forecasts (e.g., NOAA, ICON, StormGlass) provide essential large-scale information but exhibit **systematic local biases** at the M6 buoy scale.  
To correct these biases, deep learning models were trained to **predict residuals** between observed and numerically forecasted significant wave height (SWH), effectively combining **physical priors with data-driven corrections**.

### Baseline: Physical Model Forecasts

| Rank | Model | MAE | MSE |
|:----:|:------|----:|----:|
| 1 | **NOAA (day 1)** | **0.425** | **0.338** |
| 2 | **StormGlass AI (day 1)** | 0.431 | 0.336 |
| 3 | **Meteo SG (day 1)** | 0.431 | 0.336 |
| 4 | ICON SG (day 1) | 0.442 | 0.409 |
| 5 | NOAA (day 2) | 0.561 | 0.568 |

The best physical forecasts reach **MAE ≈ 0.42 m** and **MSE ≈ 0.34**, forming the baseline for hybrid correction.

### Deep Learning Residual Models

| Rank | Model | MAE | MSE | Parameters |
|:----:|:------|----:|----:|------------:|

### 📈 Performance Summary

- The **hybrid LSTM and SegRNN models** achieve **MAE ≈ 0.40 m** and **MSE ≈ 0.29**, improving upon the best physical forecast (**NOAA day 1**, MAE = 0.425, MSE = 0.338) by approximately **5.6 % (MAE)** and **13 % (MSE)**.  
- Even lightweight architectures such as **LSTM** match or surpass the best physics-only baselines, confirming the value of **residual correction**.  
- **Tree-based XGBoost** remains competitive but less robust across time windows.  
- **Transformer-based PatchTST** yields stable performance with higher computational cost.
